# Generators

Suppose you have to produce a sequence of data, such as words from some text.  One idea is to generate them all at once.  Another idea is to write a _generator_, which generates a word each time it is needed.  By writing a generator, you can leave it up to the process that uses words to decide how many of them they will want to receive. 

Generators are a basic notion of Python, and are instrumental in the implementation of iterators.  Here we present them, along with some applications.
