# Mathematical Expressions

Representing mathematical expressions has wide applications in computer science.  One obvious application is in programming languages, where representing expressions is key to interpret or compile a program.  One less obvious application is in machine learning, where the representation is used, as we will see, to drive the learning process. 

We begin by introducing a simple representation for expressions, via tuples.  On this representation we can define symbolic operations such as symbolic differentiation, variable substitution, and more.
